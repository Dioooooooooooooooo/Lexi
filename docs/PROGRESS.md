## 🚧 Known Issues

### Testing Infrastructure
- ❌ **Mobile Tests**: Jest configuration needs React Native transformer setup
- ❌ **Backend Tests**: Missing DATABASE provider mocks for NestJS services
- 📝 **Status**: Test fixes deferred - infrastructure issues unrelated to feature development

## 🔄 Next Priority Items

### High Priority
1. **Complete Jest test configuration** for both mobile and backend
2. **Set up CI/CD pipeline** with automated testing
3. **Implement proper error handling** across mobile app

### Medium Priority
1. **Add E2E testing** for critical user flows
2. **Performance optimization** for mobile app loading
3. **Enhanced logging and monitoring**

## 📊 Technical Debt

### Mobile App
- Modal component positioning issues (partially resolved)
- Jest configuration needs modernization
- Error boundaries need implementation

### Backend
- Test database setup needs improvement
- API error handling could be more consistent
- Database migrations need testing

## 🎯 Development Guidelines

### Commit Standards
- Use conventional commit format
- Include context for UI/UX changes
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

### Testing Strategy
- Fix Jest configuration before major feature work
- Unit tests for new components
- Integration tests for API endpoints

### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint + Prettier for consistency
- Code reviews for all PRs
