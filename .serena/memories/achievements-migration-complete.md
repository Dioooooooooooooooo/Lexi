# Achievements Migration - Completed Session

## What Was Accomplished
Successfully completed the achievements system migration from C# to NestJS with full CRUD functionality.

## Key Files Modified
- `backend/src/app/achievements/achievements.controller.ts` - All CRUD endpoints working
- `backend/src/app/achievements/achievements.service.ts` - Database integration with timestamps
- `backend/src/app/auth/auth.service.ts` - Fixed ESLint errors, preserved authentication logic
- `backend/src/app/user/user.service.ts` - Login streak only for Pupils

## Major Issues Resolved
1. **Route Conflicts**: Fixed route ordering - moved `/achievements/user` before `/:id`
2. **Role Authorization**: Replaced all 'Admin' roles with 'Teacher' roles
3. **Login Streak Logic**: Only track streaks for Pupils, not Teachers
4. **Timestamp Issues**: Added `created_at: new Date()` to achievement creation
5. **ESLint Errors**: Fixed all TypeScript/ESLint issues in auth.service.ts without breaking functionality

## API Endpoints Working
- `GET /achievements` - List all achievements (Teacher auth)
- `POST /achievements` - Create achievement (Teacher auth)  
- `GET /achievements/user` - Get user's achievements
- `POST /achievements/user/:achievementId` - Award achievement to user
- `GET /achievements/:id` - Get specific achievement
- `PUT /achievements/:id` - Update achievement (Teacher auth)
- `DELETE /achievements/:id` - Delete achievement (Teacher auth)

## Testing Status
- ✅ Teacher registration working (tested with Apidog)
- ✅ Authentication flow preserved
- ✅ All ESLint errors resolved
- ✅ Database schema correctly implemented

## Database Tables
- `public.achievements` - Achievement definitions
- `public.pupil_achievements` - User-achievement relationships

## Next Steps for Future Sessions
1. Test all achievement API endpoints via Apidog
2. Test pupil achievement award functionality
3. Consider adding achievement notification system
4. May need to create Teacher profiles after registration

## Technical Notes
- Used Kysely query builder for type-safe database operations
- Implemented proper bcrypt type assertions to fix ESLint
- Authentication logic completely preserved during ESLint fixes
- Route ordering is critical: specific routes before parameterized routes
