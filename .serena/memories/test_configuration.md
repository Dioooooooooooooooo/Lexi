# Test Configuration Status

## Backend Tests
**Status**: Partially fixed (1 passing, 8 failing)

### Fixed Issues:
- Jest module resolution for `@/` path alias (added moduleNameMapper to package.json)
- Updated test expectation for AppController (now expects "Welcome this is the LexiLearner API!")

### Remaining Issues:
- Tests failing due to missing KyselyDatabaseService mocks
- Services need mock providers for database dependencies

### To Fix Remaining Tests:
Each test file needs to mock KyselyDatabaseService:
```typescript
const mockKyselyService = {
  db: {
    selectFrom: jest.fn(),
    insertInto: jest.fn(),
    updateTable: jest.fn(),
    deleteFrom: jest.fn(),
  }
};

// In TestingModule:
providers: [
  ServiceClass,
  { provide: KyselyDatabaseService, useValue: mockKyselyService }
]
```

## Mobile Tests
**Status**: Not configured
- Jest configuration needs updating for React Native
- TypeScript/JSX parsing issues

## Pre-commit Testing
**Recommendation**: Don't enable test requirements until all tests are fixed
- Currently would block all commits
- Fix incrementally as modules are developed
